## The Project description:
Natural language processing will be used along with and data visualization techniques to explore and 
understand the current curriculum. The final deliverable will include a presentation with key takeaways, 
descriptions of trends and correlations, as well as a gap analysis. This could include world clouds, 
network and cluster graphics, and tables with percent of clusters. In addition, the final presentation will 
help answer the following questions to support the college:  
• What are some themes or clusters within the course description, course outcomes, and skills? 
What programs and courses address: 
o Professional skills (potentially listed in professional jobsites);  
o Hard and soft (e.g. power) skills; 
o Technology and innovation; 
o Social justice? 
o Diversity, equity, and inclusion? 
• What are themes or clusters within the program competencies and non-credit offerings? Where 
is the overlap in course descriptions and outcomes? Where are the gaps (missing skills)?
